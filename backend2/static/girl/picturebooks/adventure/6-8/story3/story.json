Soon, she found a small wooden door hidden in the trunk of a giant oak tree. The rainbow key fit perfectly into the lock, and with a soft click, the door opened to reveal a magical world full of floating lanterns, talking animals, and sparkling rivers.",

Immediately, all the lanterns lit up in dazzling colors, filling the world with joy and laughter again.",
